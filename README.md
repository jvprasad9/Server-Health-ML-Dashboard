# Server-Health-ML-Dashboard
A simple system health dashboard with CPU graph using Python and Matplotlib.

This project visualizes basic server health metrics — starting with **CPU Load** — using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

It is based on daily `.csv` data collected from custom Bash health scripts on Linux servers. This is the first step in building predictive ML dashboards for DevOps monitoring.

## 🔧 Features
- 🧠 Python-based data visualization
- 📊 Line chart for CPU Load over time
- 📁 Data from real Linux system logs
- ✅ Clean, beginner-friendly code

## 📦 Requirements

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib
