# 🛠 How I Automated Server Health Checks Using Bash  
**By Prasad  — with support from Chicha, my pocket DevOps buddy! 💛**

## ⚠️ The Problem

As a system admin, I often had to manually check CPU, memory, disk, and uptime on multiple Linux servers. It was time-consuming, repetitive, and easy to forget. I needed a simple way to automate these checks and get daily reports.

---

## 💡 The Bash Solution

I created a custom **Bash script** that collects key health metrics from each server and saves them in a report. Now, I get clean, daily insights with no manual effort.

---

## 🔍 What the Script Checks

- ✅ CPU Usage  
- ✅ Memory Usage  
- ✅ Disk Usage  
- ✅ System Uptime  
- ✅ Log Rotation  
- ✅ Cron scheduling  
- ✅ Email reporting (last 3 reports saved)

---

## ✉️ Email Integration

I added a feature to **email me the report daily**. The script keeps only the latest 3 reports and removes older ones automatically, keeping the logs light.

## 🎯 What I Learned
